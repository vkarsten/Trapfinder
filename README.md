## Task 1:
Write a function that finds the word "trap" in the given string (not case sensitive). Return "BOO!!" if found, otherwise,"Relax, there's no trap.".
Examples
*     trap("There is a trap.") ➞ "BOO!!"
*     bomb("Hey, did you think there is a TRAP?") ➞ "BOO!!"
*     bomb("This goes traaa!!!") ➞ "Relax, there's no trap."
Notes
*     The string "trap" may appear in different character cases (i.e. uppercase, lowercase, mixed).

## Task 2:
Remove Every Vowel from a String
Create a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all vowels removed.
Examples
* removeVowels("I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.") ➞ " hv nvr sn  thn prsn drnkng Dt Ck."

* removeVowels("We're gonna build a wall!") ➞ "W'r gnn bld  wll!"

* removeVowels("Happy Thanksgiving to all--even the haters and losers!") ➞ "Hppy Thnksgvng t ll--vn th htrs nd lsrs!"
Notes
“y” is not considered a vowel.
Expect a valid string for all test cases.
